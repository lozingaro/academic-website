# Didactics

Over the years, I've been creating several resources for teaching and learning purposes in the fields of computer science and machine learning.

**Are you looking for a interesting topic for your thesis?** Check out my [proposals](didactics/proposals.md) page.

## Academic courses

* [UNIBO-81940](didactics/81940.markdown) (2023 edition) part of **Artificial Intelligence** course of the Second cycle degree programme (LM) in Computer Science.
* [UNIBO-08574](didactics/08574.markdown) (2023 edition) module of **Operating Systems** course of the First cycle degree programme (L) in Information Science for Management.
* ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ [Introduzione al machine learning (parte prima)](https://github.com/lozingaro/asai-er-ml.git) part of the **Advanced school on Artificial Intelligence** ([ASAI-ER](https://asai-er.github.io)) held in Bertinoro (Italy) and promoted by _Regione Emilia Romagna_ and the _Department of Computer Science and Engineering_ of the University of Bologna.

### Machine learning resources

A set of `Python` notebooks that can be used as a starting point for teaching machine learning:

* [Linear regression with gradient descent](assets/src/linear-regression-w-gradient-descent.ipynb)
* [The neural network](assets/src/nn-rulez.ipynb)
* [The perceptron](assets/src/percettrone.ipynb)
* [Pytorch basics tutorial](assets/src/pytorch-tutorial.ipynb)
