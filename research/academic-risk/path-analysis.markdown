### Analysis of Academic Choices and Patterns Among University Students Based on Credit Load

>Are there significant differences between students who take more than 40 credits and those who take fewer than 40 credits in their first year, in terms of the subjects they take and the order in which they take these subjects? Furthermore, are the results of this analysis confirmed for the different cohorts?

---

#### Introduction

This study aims to explore the academic choices and patterns of university students, focusing on the comparison between students who enroll in more than 40 credits and those who enroll in fewer than 40 credits during their first year. The investigation extends to understanding how these patterns persist or vary across different student cohorts.

#### Data Requirements

1. **Student Academic Records:**
   - Credits Taken: Total number of credits each student takes in their first year.
   - Subjects Enrolled: Detailed information on the subjects enrolled by each student.
   - Enrollment Sequence: The chronological order of the subjects taken.

2. **Cohort Information:**
   - Academic Year of Enrollment: To categorize students into different cohorts.
   - Demographic Information (Optional): Includes age, gender, socio-economic background, etc.

3. **Academic Performance Data:**
   - Grades or GPA: To correlate with the number of credits and the choice of subjects.

4. **Program or Major Information:**
   - Declared Major or Intended Field of Study.

#### Statistical Analysis

- Distribution comparison of subjects between two groups.
- Sequence analysis for understanding the order of subject enrollment.
- Cohort analysis to evaluate patterns across different years.

#### Expected Outcome

This study aims to reveal if there are notable differences in the subjects chosen and their sequence between students with different credit loads, and whether these patterns hold true across various cohorts. Insights from this study could inform strategies in academic advising, curriculum development, and student support services.
