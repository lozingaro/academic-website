In the following sections, you'll find a list of project proposals suitable for both in-course activities and thesis work.

### Edu_I

#### Predicting University Dropout Risk

This project involves utilizing data from the academic careers of freshman students at the University of Bologna to predict the **risk of dropping out**. You can explore relevant research papers to get started:

- [Student Dropout Prediction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52237-7_11)
- [Predictive Models for Effective Policy Making Against University Dropout](https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/910769)

### Edu_II

#### Predicting Low Achievement in Secondary School

This project focuses on utilizing data from INVALSI tests in primary and secondary schools to predict **low achievement** in specific subjects (Math, Italian, or English) by the end of secondary school. Relevant research papers to consider:

- [Informing Predictive Models against Students Dropout](https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/874372)
- [Student Low Achievement Prediction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-11644-5_76)

### Med_I

#### Predicting Rehabilitation Quality

This project involves using **video data** from a patient's medical history at Bologna's IOR (Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli) to predict the quality score of their rehabilitation process.

### Med_II

#### Predicting Disease Risk from Audio Data

This project aims to predict the risk of developing a specific disease (e.g., COVID-19, pneumonia) using **audio data** from a patient's medical history. You can draw inspiration from Lorenzo Vainigli's thesis work:

- [Registrazioni vocali per la diagnosi di COVID-19 con Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/22896/1/Registrazioni%20vocali%20per%20la%20diagnosi%20di%20COVID-19%20con%20Deep%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.pdf)

### VOO_I

#### Predicting Olive Oil Quality and Origin

Collaborating with Carapelli Firenze S.p.A. and the University of Firenze, this project utilizes data from **chemical analysis of olive oil** to predict the quality, geographical origin, or cultivar of a sample of olive oil. Relevant research papers:

- [Authentication of the Geographical Origin of Virgin Olive Oils](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713520300724)
