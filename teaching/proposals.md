## Edu_I

The project aims to exploit data from the academic career of a freshman student involved at University of Bologna in order to predict the **risk of dropping out** of university.

A list of papers that can be used as a starting point for the project:

- [Student Dropout Prediction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52237-7_11)
- [Predictive models for effective policy making against university dropout](https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/910769)

## Edu_II

The project aims to exploit data from the INVALSI test (primary and secondary school) to predict **low achievement** for a specific subject (Math, Italian or English) at the end of secondary school.

A list of papers that can be used as a starting point for the project:

- [Informing predictive models against Students Dropout](https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/874372)
- [Student Low Achievement Prediction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-11644-5_76)

## Med_I

The project aims to exploit **video data** from medical history of a patient developed with Bologna's IOR (Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli) to predict the quality score of the rehabilitation process.

## Med_II

The project aims to exploit **audio data** from the medical history of a patient to predict the risk of developing a specific disease (e.g. COVID-19, pneumonia).

Lorenzo Vainigli developed a thesis work over this subject that can be used as a starting point for the project:

- [Registrazioni vocali per la diagnosi di COVID-19 con Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/22896/1/Registrazioni%20vocali%20per%20la%20diagnosi%20di%20COVID-19%20con%20Deep%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.pdf)

## VOO_I

The project aims to exploit data from the **chemical analysis of olive oil**-in collaboration with Carapelli Firenze S.p.A. and the University of Firenze-to predict the quality, geographical origin or cultivar of a sample olive oil.

A list of papers that can be used as a starting point for the project:

- [Authentication of the geographical origin of virgin olive oils from the main worldwide producing countries: A new combination of HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis of volatile compounds and chemometrics applied to 1217 samples](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713520300724)
