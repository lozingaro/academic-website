## Course Overview

The Informatica course is part of the Laurea in Matematica degree and consists of the main course (taught by Prof. Simone Martini) along with a laboratory course. For students of Filosofia, the course is adapted from the CdL in Matematica and is held in the second semester. Students are not required to take the programming test, but they are welcome to attend the laboratory.

## Laboratory

- The laboratory takes place in the same room as the lectures, with laptops provided for students.
- It is recommended to install Python via [Thonny](https://thonny.org/), a self-contained Python environment.
- All course and lab materials are available on [Moodle](https://virtuale.unibo.it/).

## Examination

The examination consists of both traditional lectures and laboratory sessions. Weekly self-assessment tests will be provided during the lab as preparation tools. Completing all assignments throughout the year awards an extra point in the final evaluation.

The examination consists of two parts:

1. Programming test (2.5 hours)
2. Written exam on paper (1 hour, no notes or references allowed)

The two parts must be completed in the same examination session.

### Programming Test

- Conducted on EOL.unibo.it with PC access.
- First part includes coding exercises with automated tests. Score between 0 and 10 is assigned immediately. If the score is below 5, the exam ends. Otherwise, the student proceeds to the second part.
- The second part involves coding exercises evaluated by the instructor and includes the written exam.
- Total duration: 2.5 hours.

### Written Exam

- Traditional written exam without notes on paper.
- Evaluated by the instructor along with the second part of the programming test.
- Total duration: 1 hour.

Final grade is determined by summing the scores of the programming test (5-10), the written exam (13-24), and potential lab bonus (0-1). If the total is 32 or more, the grade is 30Lode.
