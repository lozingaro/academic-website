## Group management

- Each group consists of 2 to 3 members. Exceptional cases (e.g., groups consisting of 1 member) can be discussed with the tutor.
- To participate in the exam, communicate your group composition via email to [me](mailto:stefano.zingaro@unibo.it).
- Email subject: **GRUPPO AI**
- Include: Group name, member names, IDs (matricola), contact email.

For those seeking a group, visit the [group list page](groups) for contact info and existing group details.

## Project structure

- Projects can be proposed by groups or course instructors (encouraged).
- Instructors' proposals are **just** general guidelines (problems, tasks, datasets).
<!-- - Check the [proposals page](proposals) for instructor-proposed projects. -->

## Evaluation process

- Two components: **written report** and **code implementation**.
- Evaluation through an oral exam discussing the project.
- All group members participate in discussing the project.
- Evaluation is sufficient if a correct experimental approach is followed. Grade depends on the effort and quality of the work.

## Report guidelines

- No length limits, 12pt font, any preferred format (e.g., `lateX`, `docx`).
- Follow the [report template](report) structure.
- Submit as a PDF file named `REPORT_AI.pdf`.

## Implementation

- Use preferred technologies for development, such as Java, Python or MiniZinc.
- Use `git` for project management.
- Store code on [GitLab](http://gitlab.com):
  1. Request access to the [AI Lab CS LM group](https://gitlab.com/ai_lab_cs_lm/2023_2024).
  2. Fork the [provided template repository](https://gitlab.com/ai_lab_cs_lm/2023_2024/ai_course_template.git).
  3. Manage --> Members --> Invite members --> Add username `@dezingaro` --> Select role `Reporter` --> Invite.

## Submission

1. Create a `Tag` named **Consegna** on GitLab.
2. Notify [me](mailto:stefano.zingaro@unibo.it) with subject: **CONSEGNA AI - GROUP NAME** to arrange the project discussion.

## Demo

- Prepare a script for automated testing.
- Can include screenshots or additional material.
- Integration with code is optional.
- Useful for further publication of the project on the web, e.g. on [GitHub](http://github.com).

## Project discussion

- Evaluation includes report analysis and code implementation.
- Exam date based on GitLab `Tag` creation.
- Exam date and details will be scheduled after submission.
