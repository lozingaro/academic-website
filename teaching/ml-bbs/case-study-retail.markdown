### Case Study Worksheet: Predictive Analytics for Customer Retention

**Name:**  
**Date:** 12 December 2023
**Course:** Machine Learning

#### Understanding the Business Problem

- **Contextualizing the Challenge**: In the context of a UK-based online retailer specializing in unique gift items, many of which are wholesalers, discuss potential challenges in customer retention. What factors might influence customer loyalty in this sector?
- **Problem Presentation**: How might you frame the problem of customer retention in a data-driven way? What types of data would be crucial for understanding this trend?
  - **Hypothetical Example**: Imagine a scenario where an online retailer observes a decline in repeat purchases over several months. How might they frame this problem in a data-driven way? Consider what types of customer data could be crucial for understanding this trend, like frequency of purchases, average transaction value, or the diversity of products purchased.
  - **Abstract Approach**: Without diving into the specific dataset yet, brainstorm how you might use data to uncover patterns or indicators of customer loyalty or attrition in an online retail setting.

#### Data Source Introduction

- **Dataset Overview**: The Online Retail II dataset includes transactions from 01/12/2009 through 09/12/2011, including product details, quantities, prices, customer information, and more.
- **Dataset Characteristics**: This dataset contains unique identifiers for transactions (InvoiceNo), products (StockCode, Description), along with Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country. Note: Cancellations are marked with a 'c' in InvoiceNo.
- **Data Set Access**: Download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - [Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II).

#### Data Exploration and Problem Identification

- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Analyze transaction patterns to identify signs of potential customer loss.
- **Key Variables**: Identify key variables in the data set that may influence customer retention (e.g., purchase frequency, order value).

#### Data Representation and Model Selection

- **Data Preparation**: Discuss how you would prepare this data set for a machine learning model (data cleaning, feature engineering).
- **Model Selection**: Propose an appropriate machine learning model for predicting customer retention based on this data set.

#### Implementing the Solution

- **Training and Testing the Model**: Outlines the steps for training and testing the model.
- **Interpreting Results**: How will you interpret the model's predictions about customer retention?

#### Business Insights and Decisions

- **Gain insights from the data**: Discuss potential business insights that can be derived from the model's predictions.
- **Strategic Actions**: Suggest strategic actions the store can take based on these insights to improve customer loyalty.

#### Reflection

- **Learning Takeaways**: What did you learn about the role of machine learning in solving real-world business problems?
- **Real-World Application**: Consider how this approach can be applied in different retail or e-commerce environments.
