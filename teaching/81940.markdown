For those seeking a group or individual students, visit the [group list page](groups) for contact info and existing group details.

## Project Structure

- Projects can be proposed by groups or course instructors.
- Instructors' proposals are guidelines (problems, tasks, datasets).
- Check the [proposals page](../proposals) for instructor-proposed projects.

## Evaluation Process

- Two components: written report and code implementation.
- Evaluation through an oral exam discussing the project.

- Follow the [report template](../report) structure.
- Submit as a PDF file named `REPORT_AI.pdf`.

## Implementation

- Use preferred technologies for development.
- Use `git` for project management.
- Store code on [GitLab](http://gitlab.com) using the provided procedure.

## Submission

1. Create a `Tag` named **Consegna** on GitLab.
2. Notify the [tutor](mailto:stefanopio.zingaro@unibo.it) with subject: **CONSEGNA AI - GROUP NAME**.

## Demo

- Prepare a script for automated testing.
- Can include screenshots or additional material.
- Integration with code is optional.

## Project Discussion
